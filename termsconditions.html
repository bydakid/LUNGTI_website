Please be advised the Services are hosted in Singapore. If you access the Services from any other region of the world with laws or other requirements governing personal data collection, use, or disclosure that differ from applicable laws in Singapore, then through your continued use of the Services, you are transferring your data to Singapore, and you expressly consent to have your data transferred to and processed in Singapore.
<br><br>
15. TERM AND TERMINATION
<br><br>
These Legal Terms shall remain in full force and effect while you use the Services.

If we terminate or suspend your account for any reason, you are prohibited from registering and creating a new account under your name, a fake or borrowed name, or the name of any third party, even if you may be acting on behalf of the third party. In addition to terminating or suspending your account, we reserve the right to take appropriate legal action, including without limitation pursuing civil, criminal, and injunctive redress.

<br><br>
17. GOVERNING LAW
<br><br>
These Legal Terms are governed by and interpreted following the laws of Belgium, and the use of the United Nations Convention of Contracts for the International Sales of Goods is expressly excluded. If your habitual residence is in the EU, and you are a consumer, you additionally possess the protection provided to you by obligatory provisions of the law in your country to residence. LUNGTI and yourself both agree to submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Brussels, which means that you may make a claim to defend your consumer protection rights in regards to these Legal Terms in Belgium, or in the EU country in which you reside.
